I already knew basics of Frontend development before the start of LEAD. I'd started learning Frontend Web Development from March. 
Looking forward to learn new techniques through the project.

While doing the project,
 - I learnt to use the flex property. 
 - I also learnt to use the css clip path generator which is really helpful in shaping different things.
 - I learnt about progress tag.
 - I got to know about Font Awesome and used it.It's amazing.
 - I learnt to add a reponsive navigation bar using jQuery for making it mobile friendly.
 - I also leart to call API using JS and make changes in the main file using jQuery.
