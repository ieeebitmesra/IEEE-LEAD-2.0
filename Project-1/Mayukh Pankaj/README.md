 ## Tech Stack 💻 ##
 
 * HTML 5
 * CSS 
 * Javascript
 * Bootstrap 4 

I like to use bootstrap for developing websites because targeting breakpoints is much easier, just add 
add class "col-sm-12" instead of making media queries. bootstrap cards used for showcasing projects.
add animations & override with !important in separate stylesheet for final result. 

**UNIQUE 🚀**

I wanted to implement dark/light mode 🌙 feature since I first used it. 
It's simply overriding body class properties like body-background, color on event of a button click.

I prefer aesthetic design, so I used have solid colors, icons & smooth animations. Added favicon Ⓜ

**IMPROVEMENT 🔍**

* localstorage for saving user dark/light choice.
* optimise GIF 
* working on Jekyll blog
