Portfolio

Hey! I'm happy to tell you that I have created my first front-end web page, it showcases my 
Portfolio hosted on github pages entirely made using HTML and CSS.

It consists of a modern layout allowing easy navigation, smooth scrolling and accessibility of information.. No external libraries have been used in this website. I made this website as responsive as I could, but still it has minor issues when viewed in mobile mode.
