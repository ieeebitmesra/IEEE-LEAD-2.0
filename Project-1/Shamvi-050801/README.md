NAME:SHAMBHAVI SINGH

MY EXPERIENCE:
In this project I got to learn many new things about html and css in very short amount of time. It was a tiresome journey but was an Insightful one.

IMPROVEMENTS:
Now this website is just a crack version it can be furnished more using animations and with advance knowledge of javascript to make it more appealing. But still for a first attempt I think it was a good effort. I faced alot of problems to make this website responsive tried many times  and finally after so many experiments I think it was sorted .
