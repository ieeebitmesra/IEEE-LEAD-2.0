*DESCRIPTION (About Project)*

*My project has a landing page which has loading animations. As the logo and the header appear we can move across various pages(sections).

*The about section has a brief description about me with my photo attached. It has a readmore button which directs you to a separate page which has additonal data.

*Here i tried to cover the min projects too.

*The Last is contact page.

The header always stays on the top which has the navbar and the logo. The logo is also a link that directs to the landing page.

The separated pages also have some loading animations.

*PROBLEMS FACED*

The problem that I faced was was that I wanted it to be reponsive but it was difficult for me to make it just how I expected to be on the mobile. However I managed to do it in the end with alot of redos in many sections.


*WHAT YOU LEARNED?*

Other than HTML, CSS and Javascript, I learned that just jumping to the work doesn't help. You must plan it first. You must have a clear idea about how you want your project to look like when done. Accordingly plan the execution. I also learnt that organised work is easy to edit and develop. I got this project when I was bombarded with college assignments all at once. Still I could achieve the milestone. So, i definitely learnt time management from this project.
