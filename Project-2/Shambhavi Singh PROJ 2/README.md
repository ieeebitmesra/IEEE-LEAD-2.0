 My project has been divided into three small parts

2. **WEBSITES SCRAPING:** 
    -LinkedIn Scraping:this website is really very hard to scrape . I tried a lot but the only thing i was able to scrape was the number of jobs available and the job title . Also the images were scraped of the official website.

  **PROBLEMS FACED**
  At the beginning I had basic problem with the syntax of python . Little bit problem was faced during scraping but once I got handy with it it was  really fun to scrape if the website had a clean html. GUI was the toughest rather very tiresome job to do. The GUI Designed is really a basic one can be improved further a lot. But it was fun to learn new things.
