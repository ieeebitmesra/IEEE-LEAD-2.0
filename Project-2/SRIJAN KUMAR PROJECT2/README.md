DESCRIPTION

This projects consists of 2 python codes:-

2. jobScraperWithGUI

PROBLEM FACED 

I faced some problem in scraping google search results. Moreover , it is difficult to design/beautifty the GUI using Tkinter.I resolved all the problems using my mentor's advice.

MODIFICATIONS IN FUTURE

I am going to add left(<<) and right(>>) navigate buttons , which when clicked show the next job in the list of Jobs I created . Also , I will learn some advanced modules like Selenium to scrape dynamic websites with greater ease. 

WHAT I LEARNED

Python language was completely new to me .Knowing such a powerful language was very amazing . I learnt how easily things like simple calculators and csv files containing large complex data are made using Python .I learned the uses of python libraries like bs4 , requests , webbrowser , PIL and Tkinter.

This is the demo video link of my GUI for project 2 :
