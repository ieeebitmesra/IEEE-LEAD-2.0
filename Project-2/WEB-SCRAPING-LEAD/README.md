  **PROBLEMS FACED**
  At the beginning I had basic problem with the syntax of python . Little bit problem was faced during scraping but once I got handy with it it was  really fun to scrape if the website had a clean html. GUI was the toughest rather very tiresome job to do. The GUI Designed is really a basic one can be improved further a lot. But it was fun to learn new things.
