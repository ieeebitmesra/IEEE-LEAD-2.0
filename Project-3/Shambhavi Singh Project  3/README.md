**PROBLEM FACED**
At start it was really difficult to work with such large data . But with time it became easy. Still I was stuck many a times during fetching the data of current coordinates.This websites can be improved by additional features like increasing the speed at which data are being fetched.

**WHAT I LEARNED**
This was my first time where I was dealing with such big data of real world .It helped me learn about how in actual life people implement these data(using API) for public knowledge.
